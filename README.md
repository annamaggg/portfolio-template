  <h1>Portfolio Website Template</h1>
  <p>This template was created as learning material for a module in the OpenSkills curriculum. The module aims to provide students with the skills to create their own digital portfolio and demonstrate their projects/experience to potential employers. </p>
  <h2>Lesson notes</h2>
  <p>Students can uncomment stylesheet imports in the head of index.html to see how the same portfolio site can be experienced with different styling. This project may be used as reference for their own portfolio websites. Students should be encouraged to think about how colours, fonts, spacing and movement impact the user's experience. How might they want to present and express themselves through visual style in their own portfolios? </p>
